# Resume Project

I would like to make project that is just start with json scheme is like shown below

```
projects.schema ={
  title : "string",
  description : "string",
  is_opensource : "booelan",
  repo_url : "string",
  starte_date : "Date",
  end_date : "Date"
}
company.schema = {
  name : "string",
  join_date : "Date",
  exit_date : "Date",
  role : "string"
}
```

That's all
